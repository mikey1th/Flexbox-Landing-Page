                    <p> Logos, in short, are great. They exist to condense ideas, feelings, organizations, movements, and so much more into
                    a memorable, unique, visually appealing icon. Because so much work goes into them many people see logos as pieces of art
                    in and of themselves. Most often, this coms out when we see a nice logo on a packaged good or piece of apparal and make
                    a purchase decision based on nothing more than the fact that we "just liked the logo."
